The web application is composed of:
 1. _A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)_
 2. _A website (the front-end) that shows the final product: static and dynamic_
 3. _A database or files that store data (data = objects)_
 4. _An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)_

**Description of the console**

  
  This is the initial stage of the project whereby we aim to establish a method for managing the objects to be used by our web page through the implementation of a database in JSON format. We will apply object-oriented programming, data translation with Python, and command-line logic, we aim to develop a local database that can be modified via commands.
